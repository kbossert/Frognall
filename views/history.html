Bowers, Fredson. Principles of Bibliographical Description. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1949; several reprint editions; paperback edition, with introduction by G. Thomas Tanselle, New Castle, DE: Oak Knoll Press, 1994. Anyone with a serious interest in bibliography and the history of books and printing should tackle this magisterial, but challenging work at some point. If you have the time, please read at least Chapters 5 (skipping over the finer print) and 7, and Appendix I (pp. 193–254, 269–311, 457–462; see also Gaskell, pp. 328–335 for a very concise—but not fully accurate—summary of these chapters.) The basic concepts elucidated by Bowers will be covered in class. Then read (or re-read) Bowers after taking this course, by which time his discussion should make considerably more sense.

Pearson, David. Provenance Research in Book History: A Handbook. London: The British Library; New Castle, DE: Oak Knoll Press, 1998. Despite its heavily Anglocentric focus, this is a very useful introduction to marks of provenance and their identification, though the many illustrations tend to be a bit small and murky. Please read pp. 1–26, 38–70, 82–139, and 274–296; skim the rest to the extent of your interest. Presently out of print and difficult to find.

Pearson, David. English Bookbinding Styles 1450–1800. London: The British Library; New Castle, DE: Oak Knoll Press, 2005; corrected 2nd printing, 2014. Another useful introduction to a very complex and amorphous subject. The text and illustrations (many in color) provide an essential expansion of Gaskell’s extremely limited coverage. Only partly applicable to binding styles elsewhere in Europe, but at least this is a start. Please read pp. x–xi, 1–40, and browse pp. 41–163.

The Anatomy of a Book: I. Format in the Hand-Press Period. Written by Terry Belanger and directed by Peter Herdrich. 1991. 30 minutes.
